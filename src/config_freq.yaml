# Configuration for FREQUENCY-DOMAIN signal convolution experiment
# 
# This config trains a transformer to learn convolution in the frequency domain.
# The model receives signals as frequency-domain vectors of length 2p=128
# (interleaved real and imaginary parts).
#
# Hypothesis: Frequency-domain learning should be easier because convolution
# becomes element-wise multiplication (linear operation).
